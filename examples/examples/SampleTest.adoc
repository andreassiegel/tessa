|Description
|This test acts as a showcase to illustrate how documentation in the test class is turned into a
test documentation file.

|Status
|Documented

|===

== Prerequisites

In order to get nice and meaningful test documentation out of a Java file,
a few things need to be taken into account when writing the file:

- @DisplayName annotations need to be used
- test cases should be organized in regions
- the class itself as well as individual test cases need Javadoc comments
- additional information is set in a block comment at class level

== Setup

This needs to be done before all the tests can run.

== Cleanup

This needs to be done after all tests ran.

== Test Cases

WARNING: These tests are currently not working because there is no implementation.
